# Rails Capstone

This is the Ruby on Rails capstone project that is based on lifestyle articles website. I personalize the content to be a motorcycles articles. 

You can see the original design [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14554909/liFEsTlye-Mobile-version)
Design idea by [Nelson Sakwa on Behance](https://www.behance.net/sakwadesignstudio)

On the navbar, I include a button for more categories because I want to include all the categories existing for the topic.
In the original project, the forms, and the article doesn't have design, so I created my designs trying to follow the guidelines of the given design.
